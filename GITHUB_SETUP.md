# ðŸš€ GitHub Setup Guide

## Create GitHub Repository

1. **Go to GitHub.com** and sign in
2. **Click the "+" icon** in the top-right corner
3. **Select "New repository"**
4. **Repository name:** `substack-sidebar-blocker`
5. **Description:** `Chrome extension to block Substack recommendation sections`
6. **Make it Public** (so others can use it)
7. **Don't initialize** with README (we already have one)
8. **Click "Create repository"**

## Push Your Code

After creating the repository, run these commands in your terminal:

```bash
# Add the remote repository
git remote add origin https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/substack-sidebar-blocker.git

# Push your code
git branch -M main
git push -u origin main
```

Replace `YOUR_USERNAME` with your actual GitHub username.

## Repository Structure

Your repository will contain:
- `manifest.json` - Extension configuration
- `script.js` - Main JavaScript logic  
- `styles.css` - CSS to hide recommendations
- `test.html` - Test page
- `README.md` - Documentation
- Icon files (optional)

## Next Steps

Once pushed to GitHub:
1. **Add a release** with the extension files
2. **Add topics** like: `chrome-extension`, `substack`, `productivity`, `ad-blocker`
3. **Share the repository** with others who want to use it

## Usage Instructions for Others

Users can install the extension by:
1. Downloading the repository
